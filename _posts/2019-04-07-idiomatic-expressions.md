“A penny for your thoughts”, Sarah inquired, “I’m on the edge of my seat.” She knew that she was taking a shot in the dark but even a blind pig finds an acorn sometimes. Sarah had stuck by Jack through thick and thin and even though he was becomming more and more like Old Man Jenkins, she had high hopes that given the benefit of the doubt the truth would set Jack free. “Spill the beans,” she added, “there’s no use in sweeping it under the carpet!”

“Life is unfair”, Jack replied. “Same shit, different day. I went to the school of hard knocks and I learned that there are lies, damned lies and statistics. I may have one foot in the grave but my stomach is tied up in knots. I lie down with dogs and wake up with fleas, licking my wounds. I used to think I had it bad because I had no shoes, then I met a man with no feet. I try to keep a stiff upper lip but I can’t get the monkey off my back. It’s a dog eat dog world and I’m only human.”

“Jeez, who peed in your cornflakes”, she asked. “Life’s not so bad, when you consider the alternative. Tomorrow is another day. You thought that if you just built a better mousetrap the world would beat a path to your door. Well, open your eyes; we’re not in Kansas anymore. It’s like my daddy used to say, it’s not whether you win or lose, its how you play the game, for God’s sake.”

“Pipe down”, he replied, “I was treated like the red-headed stepchild. Idle hands are the devil’s workshop but when push came to shove, I kept my nose to the grindstone. When God gave me lemons I made lemonade. I tried to lay it on the line with you but you’ve been cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey. Maybe it’s just time to get the hell out of Dodge and get on with my life.”

“Well, spank my ass and call me Judy”, Sarah retorted. “Don’t get your knickers in a twist. To be honest with you, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. We all have our crosses to bear but wake up and smell the coffee. Life is what you make it but this takes the cake. Get a hold of yourself and lighten up!”

“Bite me.”

“Screw you.”
